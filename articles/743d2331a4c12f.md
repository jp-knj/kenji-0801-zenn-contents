## Èñ¢Êï∞„Ç≥„É≥„Éù„Éº„Éç„É≥„Éà 
When using function components without any props you don‚Äôt have the need to use extra types. Everything can be inferred. In old-style functions (which I prefer), as well as in arrow functions.
```javascript
function Title() {
    return <h1>Welcome to this application</h1>;
}
```

## Props
When using props we name props usually according to the component we‚Äôre writing, with a Props-suffix. No need to use FC component wrappers or anything similar.

```typescript
type GreetingProps = {
    name: string;
};

function Greeting(props: GreetingProps) {
    return <p>Hi {props.name} üëã</p>
}
```

Destructuring makes it even more readable
```typescript
function Greeting({ name }: GreetingProps) {
    return <p>Hi {name} üëã</p>;
}
```

# Default props
Instead of setting default props, like in class-based React, it‚Äôs easier to set default values to props. We mark props with a default value optional (see the question-mark operator). The default value makes sure that name is never undefined.

```typescript
type LoginMsgProps = {
    name?: string;
};

function LoginMsg({ name = "Guest" }: LoginMsgProps) {
    return <p>Logged in as {name}</p>;
}
```

# Children
Instead of using FC or FunctionComponent helpers we prefer to set children explicitly, so it follows the same pattern as other components. We set children to type React.ReactNode as it accepts most (JSX elements, strings, etc.)
```typescript
type CardProps = {
    title: string;
    children: React.ReactNode;
};

export function Card({ title, children }: CardProps) {
    return (
        <section className="cards">
            <h2>{title}</h2>
    {children}
    </section>
);
}
```


When we set children explicitly, we can also make sure that we never pass any children.
```typescript
// This throws errors when we pass children
type SaveButtonProps = {
//... whatever
children: never
}
```

See my arguments why I don‚Äôt use FC in this editoral.

## WithChildren helper type
A custom helper type helps us to set children easier.
```typescript
type WithChildren<T = {}> =
T & { children?: React.ReactNode };

type CardProps = WithChildren<{
title: string;
}>;
```

This is very similar to FC, but with the default generic parameter to {}, it can be much more flexible:
```typescript
// works as well
type CardProps = { title: string } & WithChildren;
```
If you are using Preact, you can use h.JSX.Element or VNode as a type instead of React.ReactNode.

## Spread attributes to HTML elements
Spreading attributes to HTML elements is a nice feature where you can make sure that you are able to set all the HTML properties that an element has without knowing upfront which you want to set. You pass them along. Here‚Äôs a button wrapping component where we spread attributes. To get the right attributes, we access a button's props through JSX.IntrinsicElements. This includes children, we spread them along.

```typescript
type ButtonProps = JSX.IntrinsicElements["button"];

function Button({ ...allProps }: ButtonProps) {
    return <button {...allProps} />;
}
```

## Preset attributes
Let‚Äôs say we want to preset type to button as the default behavior submit tries to send a form, and we just want to have things clickable. We can get type safety by omitting type from the set of button props.

```typescript
type ButtonProps = Omit<JSX.IntrinsicElements["button"], "type">;
function Button({ ...allProps }: ButtonProps) {
    return <button type="button" {...allProps} />;
}
```

```typescript
// üí• This breaks, as we omitted type
const z = <Button type="button">Hi</Button>;
```
## Styled components
Not to be confused with the styled-components CSS-in-JS library. We want to set CSS classes based on a prop we define. E.g. a new type property that allows being set to either primary or secondary.

We omit the original type and className and intersect with our own types:
```typescript
type StyledButton = Omit<
JSX.IntrinsicElements["button"],
"type" | "className"
> & {
type: "primary" | "secondary";
};

function StyledButton({ type, ...allProps }: StyledButton) {
    return <Button className={`btn-${type}`} />;
}
```

## Required properties
We dropped some props from the type definition and preset them to sensible defaults. Now we want to make sure our users don‚Äôt forget to set some props. Like the alt attribute of an image or the src attribute.

For that, we create a MakeRequired helper type that removes the optional flag.

```typescript

type MakeRequired<T, K extends keyof T> = Omit<T, K> &
    Required<{ [P in K]: T[P] }>;
```
And build our props with that:
```typescript
type ImgProps
= MakeRequired<
JSX.IntrinsicElements["img"],
"alt" | "src"
>;

export function Img({ alt, ...allProps }: ImgProps) {
return <img alt={alt} {...allProps} />;
}

const zz = <Img alt="..." src="..." />;
```

## Controlled Input
When you use regular input elements in React and want to pre-fill them with values, you can‚Äôt change them anymore afterward. This is because the value property is now controlled by React. We have to put value in our state and control it. Usually, it‚Äôs enough to just intersect the original input element‚Äôs props with our own type. It‚Äôs optional as we want to set it to a default empty string in the component later on.

```typescript
type ControlledProps = JSX.IntrinsicElements["input"] & { 
    value?: string;
};
```

Alternatively, we can drop the old property and rewrite it:

```typescript
type ControlledProps = Omit<JSX.IntrinsicElements["input"], "value"> & { 
    value?: string;
};
```

And use useState with default values to make it work. We also forward the onChange handler we pass from the original input props.
```typescript
function Controlled({value = "", onChange, ...allProps}: ControlledProps) {
    const [val, setVal] = useState(value);
    return (
        <input
            value={val}
            {...allProps}
            onChange={e => {
                setVal(() => e.target?.value);
                onChange && onChange(e);
            }}
        />
    )
}
```
